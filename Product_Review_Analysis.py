# Task 1: Keyword Highlighter
# Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", 
# and "average". We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review. Print out each review with the keywords 
# in uppercase so they stand out.

           "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."]

# Task 2: Sentiment Tally
# Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review.  
# The function should return the total count of positive and negative words.

# Task 3: Review Summary
# Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
# Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.
